### Button
- Implemented `colorPalette`, `size`, `variant`, `loading` and `loadingText` props from **Chakra**.
- Implemented `children` and `onClick` to make this component more compatible for `<button>`.
- Used **Reuse Styles** feature of **Tailwindcss** by writing `button.css` file.
- Defined color palette in `tailwind.config.js` file not to repeat each time.
#### Challenge
- Biggest challenge was to implement combination of two or more props that are related to each other. In the end, I decided to make each combination manually.
- After creating various palettes, I realized that the test is to make **"Deezer design system"**. So I decided to keep what I've done and add more "Deezer" buttons.
- For more desciption, please check `*.tsx` files in `src/components`.

### Alert
- Implemented `title`, `status`, `variant`, `size` props from **Chakra**.
- Used **Reuse Styles** feature of **Tailwindcss** by writing `alert.css` file.
- Defined color palette in `tailwind.config.js` file not to repeat each time.
#### Challenge
- With `status`, `variant`, `colorPalette`, there are too many combinations to implement. I decided not to do all for this test. I used `colorPalette` only for **Deezer** design.
- For more desciption, please check `*.tsx` files in `src/components`.
